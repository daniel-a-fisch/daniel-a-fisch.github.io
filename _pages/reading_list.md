## Reading List

A small collection of links to online resources that I find exciting and insightful.

### Blogs

### Videos

- [Veritasium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM): Popular science channel covering a wide range of topics from the world of science, from maths to physics to game theory.
