**I am an Economist and Theoretical Physicist** who strives to actively contribute to the solution of some of the most relevant societal problems. By providing tools, theories and models to understand the underlying dynamics, I aim to empower society to address the fundamental root causes in an effective and efficient way. \
More precisely, I intend to achieve this by combining economic modeling and analyses with methods from the physics of complex systems, network dynamics and stochastic processes which I have already applied in research about opinion dynamics at the University of Cambridge and about ride pooling at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (see illustrations below).<br>

I am intrigued by emergent phenomena and want to **understand how underlying micro-level interactions lead to macro-dynamics and influence aggregate economic outcomes**. In particular, I am interested in questions about how, in network economics, the mechanisms of individual social interactions determine our aggregate behaviour, how in labour economics, by matching workers and employers, wages and unemployment are shaped, and how heterogeneous agents drive macroeconomics.<br>

## Bio

Currently, I work for [QuantCo](https://www.quantco.com/) as a data scientist. I hold a Masters degree in both Economics ([BSE](https://www.bse.eu), 2024) and Applied Mathematics ([University of Cambridge](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/), 2023). Previously, I graduated from the [University of Goettingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/20493.html/) with a BSc in Physics in 2022.\
For more details, see my [CV](https://daniel-a-fisch.github.io/files/CV_Daniel-Fisch.pdf).
