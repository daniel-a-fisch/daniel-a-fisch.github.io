**I am a Theoretical Physicist and Economist** who strives to actively contribute to the solution of the most relevant social problems. By providing tools, theories and models to understand the underlying dynamics, I aim to empower society to address the fundamental root causes in an effective and efficient way. More precisely, I intend to achieve this by combining economic analyses with methods from the physics of complex systems, network dynamics and stochastic processes which I have already applied in research about opinion dynamics at the University of Cambridge and about ride pooling at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization.\

## Bio

I am a current MSc student in Economics at [BSE](bse.eu). Previously, I graduated from the [University of Cambridge](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/) with a MASt in Applied Mathematics in 2023 and from the [University of Goettingen](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/20493.html/) with a BSc in Physics in 2022.\
For more details, see my [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv).
